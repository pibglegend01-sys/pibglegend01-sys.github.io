## 📖 About the Project

Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV) in Indore is a premier institution with a rich legacy of academic excellence. Navigating the university's online portals for the latest notices, exam schedules, or syllabi is a daily routine for thousands of people. As a current third-year B.Com student at DAVV, I experienced firsthand the need for a more intuitive, user-friendly digital experience. 

This repository houses a complete frontend redesign of the official DAVV website. The goal of this **DAVV redesign** is to provide a modern look, fluid navigation, and smooth animations that better reflect the university's "A+ NAAC Accredited" standard. It blends clean graphic design principles with modern web development to make finding information—from undergraduate courses to contact details—effortless for students, faculty, and visitors alike.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modern User Interface (UI):** A clean, contemporary layout replacing legacy tables and clustered menus.
* **Smooth Animations:** Engaging, lightweight web animation frameworks that make interactions feel responsive and dynamic.
* **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for seamless viewing across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** Streamlined access to critical sections like Admissions, Academic Programs, Notices, and Results.
* **Quick Links Integration:** Easy access to essential portals like MPOnline, Swayam, and AISHE.

## 🎯 Why a DAVV Redesign?

When searching for "DAVV" online, users are often looking for quick access to campus updates or specific department pages. The official site holds a massive amount of data, but presenting it cleanly is a challenge. This project reimagines how that information is structured, prioritizing a student-first user experience and modern web aesthetics. 

## 💻 Tech Stack

This project was built with a focus on modern web development techniques:
* **HTML5 / CSS3:** For structural semantics and custom, responsive styling.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and logic.
* **Animation Libraries:** To power the smooth scrolling, hover states, and transition effects.
