A conceptual redesign of the official **Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV)** website. This project focuses on transforming the traditional academic interface into a modern, user-centric experience with smooth animations, improved navigation, and a clean aesthetic.

## 🌟 Overview

- **Modernize the Aesthetic:** Using a contemporary color palette and typography.
- **Fluid Animations:** Implementing smooth transitions to make navigation feel intuitive.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Faster access to student services like results, time tables, and the UTD portal.
